# Monadic arrows

This package serves the purpose of offering the [`dunai`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai) from other backends that also implement monadic stream functions, such as [`essence-of-live-coding`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/essence-of-live-coding), https://hackage.haskell.org/package/varying, https://hackage.haskell.org/package/netwire, or this gist here: https://gist.github.com/turion/c775d388771fcf95f86dc52cefed8898

Currently, `dunai` is the only implementation of this type class, but `essence-of-live-coding` is close: https://github.com/turion/dunai-live/
